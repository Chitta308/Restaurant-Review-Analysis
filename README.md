User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive interface for inputting reviews and viewing results.
Technologies
Python: Core language for data processing and model training.
Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning model building and evaluation.
NLTK: For text preprocessing and stemming.
Streamlit: Frontend for the web app to analyze reviews interactively.
Future Improvements
Adding more granular sentiment analysis (e.g., rating from 1-5).
Integrating with larger datasets for enhanced model accuracy.
Expanding to detect specific aspects like food quality, service, and ambiance.
